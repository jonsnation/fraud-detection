## Problem Statement
Financial fraud is a growing global issue, causing billions of dollars in losses each year. Traditional fraud detection methods struggle to adapt to evolving fraud patterns. The goal of this project is to create a real-time fraud detection system that improves accuracy and adaptability by leveraging machine learning and explainable AI tools. The system aims to identify fraudulent transactions more effectively and provide transparency through interpretability techniques.

## Justification
Fraud not only results in significant financial losses but also undermines public trust in financial systems. Current rule-based detection systems have high false-positive rates and fail to adapt to emerging threats. A machine learning-driven approach can enhance detection by learning complex patterns from transaction data. Additionally, using explainable AI tools such as SHAP and LIME will improve model interpretability, making the detection process more reliable and trustworthy.

## Expected Outcomes
The project aims to produce a high-accuracy fraud detection model capable of analyzing transactions in real-time. A monitoring dashboard built with Streamlit or Dash will provide visual insights into transaction risks, while an API developed using Flask will allow real-world integration. Explainable AI methods will enhance the interpretability of the model's predictions. The final deliverables will include a comprehensive report detailing the project's methodology, findings, and recommendations for practical implementation.
